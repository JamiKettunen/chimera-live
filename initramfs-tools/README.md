Git commit: 082e7a900a28e27e581d4a527fca79b78be50eec

These scripts have been modified according to the needs
of the Chimera Linux project. The changes are in general
not upstreamable, but we will keep this in sync.

The scripts consist of an initramfs-tools module plus
a bunch of script infrastructure needed for live booting.
