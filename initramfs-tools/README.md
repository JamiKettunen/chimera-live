Git commit: e2486cc1ac44bb40f0ba2d6ec757e14624daade4

These scripts have been modified according to the needs
of the Chimera Linux project. The changes are in general
not upstreamable, but we will keep this in sync.

The scripts consist of an initramfs-tools module plus
a bunch of script infrastructure needed for live booting.
